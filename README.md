# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this study guide to help better prepaire students for the bootcamp. This will make it easier for them to look back at important topics they learned in the prework. If they didn't have access to one then they would have a late start to the bootcamp. I learned the building blocks of a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also learning how to build a webpage.

## Usage

This study guide is used by navigating to various topics like HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Git. You can see JavaScript in action when going to DevTools by Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). There you can see a list of the topics we learned and suggestions on which topic to study first.
